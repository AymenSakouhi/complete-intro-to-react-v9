So far we've been writing React without JSX, something that I don't know anyone that actually does with their apps. _Everyone_ uses JSX. I show you this way so what JSX is actually doing is demystified to you. It doesn't do hardly anything. It just makes your code a bit more readable.

If I write `React.createElement("h1", { id: "main-title" }, "My Website");`, what am I actually trying to have rendered out? `<h1 id="main-title">My Website</h1>`, right? What JSX tries to do is to shortcut this translation layer in your brain so you can just write what you mean.

Make a new file called Pizza.jsx.

> Make sure you call it `.jsx` and not `.js`. Vite won't do JSX transpilation if it's not named with a JSX file extension.

```javascript
const Pizza = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="pizza">
      <h1>{props.name}</h1>
      <p>{props.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Pizza;
```

I don't know about you, but I find this far more readable. And if it feels uncomfortable to you to introduce HTML into your JavaScript, I invite you to give it a shot until the end of the workshop. By then it should feel a bit more comfortable. And you can always go back to the old way.

However, now you know _what_ JSX is doing for you. It's just translating those HTML tags into `React.createElement` calls. _That's it._ Really. No more magic here. JSX does nothing else. Many people who learn React don't learn this.

Notice the strange `{props.name}` syntax: this is how you output JavaScript expressions in JSX. An expression is anything that can be the right side of an assignment operator in JavaScript, e.g. `const x = <anything that can go here>`. If you take away the `{}` it will literally output `props.name` to the DOM.

> Notice we don't have to do `import React from 'react'` here like we used to. The latest version of JSX handles that for you so you only need to explicitly import the React package when you need to use something from it; otherwise feel free to do JSX without having to import React!

## ESLint

Let's fix our ESLint as JSX adds new twists and turns we need help with. Please install

```bash
npm i -D eslint-plugin-react@7.37.1
```

Then in your eslint.config.mjs

```javascript
// at top

// under js.configs.recommended
{
  ...reactPlugin.configs.flat.recommended,
  settings: {
    react: {
      version: "detect",
    },
  },
},
reactPlugin.configs.flat["jsx-runtime"],

// add to files
files: ["**/*.js", "**/*.jsx"], // add JSX

// inside the same object files, top level field
rules: {
  "react/no-unescaped-entities": "off",
  "react/prop-types": "off",
},
```

We have to add two configs, one to allow ESLint to understand React and add some basic React rules, and one to modernize it as React 17 changed a bit how ESLint interacts with React.

We're also turning off two rules that I don't find particularly useful: unescaped entites (which make you change things like `'` into `&apos`) and prop types which no one has used in a decade at this point. Otherwise we should be good to go.

## Back to JSX

So now JSX is demystified a bit, let's go convert App.js.

```javascript
// rename the file App.jsx
// delete the React import
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import Pizza from "./Pizza";

// delete the Pizza component

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Padre Gino's Pizza ‚Äì Order Now</h1>
      <Pizza name="Pepperoni" description="Mozzarella Cheese, Pepperoni" />
      <Pizza
        name="The Hawaiian Pizza"
        description="Sliced Ham, Pineapple, Mozzarella Cheese"
      />
      <Pizza
        name="The Big Meat Pizza"
        description="Bacon, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Chorizo Sausage"
      />
    </div>
  );
};

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(React.createElement(App));
```

Also head over to index.html and change the script tag

```html
<script type="module" src="./src/App.jsx"></script>
```

Notice we have Pizza as a component. Notice that the `P` in `Pizza` is capitalized. It _must_ be. If you make it lowercase, it will try to have `pizza` as a web component and not a React component.

We now pass props down as we add attributes to an HTML tag. Pretty cool.

## The API / Image Server

For this course we will use a little Fastify server I built for you. It's in the [api][api]
directory. We are going to use Vite.js to proxy to this API server. This is a useful trick to do for local development if you have a separate frontend in a backend. Normally you'd have something like NGINX routing traffic to separate frontend and backend servers. For now we'll just use Vite.

Add this to you vite.config.js

```javascript
// replace export
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "http://localhost:3000",
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
      "/public": {
        target: "http://localhost:3000",
        changeOrigin: true,
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

Now run your API server by running api/server.js by running `node api/server.js`. Note that this server is _outside_ your project directory. If you're in the project directory, you'll have to run `node ../api/server.js`. You need both servers running at the same time. Your Vite server will intercept `api` and `public` calls and reroute them to your API server!

Now let's add images to our Pizza.

```javascript
// return inside Pizza, inside div, under <p>
<img src={props.image} alt={props.name} />
```

Now in App.jsx

```javascript
// add to first Pizza
image={"/public/pizzas/pepperoni.webp"}

// add to second Pizza
image={"/public/pizzas/hawaiian.webp"}

// add to third Pizza
image={"/public/pizzas/big_meat.webp"}
```

And now you should have images!
